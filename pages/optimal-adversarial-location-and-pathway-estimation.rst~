Optimal Adversarial Location and Pathway Estimation Using Remotely Sensed Spectral-Terrain Data: A Graphical Modeling Approach

1. First we attempt to reduce dimensionality by eliminating redundant noise in the HSI image. The primary method employed was PCA.

   .. math::
      \mathbf{T}_L = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{W}_L

   Keeping only the first :math:`L` principal components, produced by using only the first :math:`L` eigenvectors. We attempt to classify using :math:`L=7`.

2. We then attempt to reduce dimensionality by searching for a spectral dictionary of linearly independent signals using a novel algorithm ATGP, which performs an orthogonal subspace projection on the raw HSI data. ATGP defines each pixel mathematically as the follow:

   .. math::
      Y_pixel=a_0 P_0+a_1 P_1+...+a_n P_n

   We then iteratively create a spectral dictionary from the most abundant spectrally distinct signals in each pixel, constrained to some number of targets :math:`T=7`.
